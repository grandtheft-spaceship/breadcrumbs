Breadcrumbs
===========

Have you ever lost some code, or lost the key insight to a long forgotten method or strategy between commits to the Ã¦ther?

How about watching coding tutorials; those are a thing right? The fact that you have to continuously pause and copy code, frame to frame, just to test it out is so barbaric.

There must be a better way...

The team over here at 'breadcrumbs.io' has you covered. We have crafted a time-travel-style record function that allows you to record a coding session across all files of the project and repository. This allows you to version control the history of your project and save lost genius at all times.

While in a tutorial or viewing a downloaded recording, you can checkout a sandbox branch and have no fear of losing the state of the saved history. It's like a parallel timeline of knowledge and experiments, free to play with and destroy at your convenience.

Find your lost code with the magic of the time travel bar.

Getting Started
---------------

Get off that Sublime Text teet and step into the future by installing [Atom.](atom.io)

### Installing

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Install [Atom.](atom.io)
- Install [breadcrumbs.](https://atom.io/packages/breadcrumbs)
- Your welcome!

### Features

**Live coding mode:**

- For best results: Start the recording session on blank documents or from base files to enjoy the dream of never loosing a line of code again.

- Press record at any point in the coding process to capture all the goodness that otherwise could be forgotten with the passing of time.

- You can toggle the recording on or off depending on what you level of risk you are willing to take due to loss of mental fortitude.

**Tutorial mode:**

- Unlike a video, where the code is untouchable and you have to grasp at the bits of knowledge as they speed past you, or having to pause every frame, you can play to your hearts content with every character that comes in a tutorial.

- As a student of the coding arts, consume glorious syntax and recursive formulas from the comfort of your own editor and environment.

- Download a tutorial repo from the Breadcrumbs repository or from your trusted tutorial source and load it up in atom.

- As you scroll through the timeline, code and comments will appear on the screen.

- You can edit the code in the window and undo all changes at anytime with the git version control that is built into the package.

- If you make a change that you wish to save, commit them to a branch to view later.

**Teacher mode:**

- In true live code fashion, you can bestow all your hard earned knowledge via the record functions.

- Just save a new named file and press record.

- Once you are done with the live code session, toggle off record.

- To add comments at points in the code, after the recording session, just rewind the code and click the pencil icon to enter a comment at each point you feel needed and they will be tagged, and popup when in tutorial playback mode.

- Comments are in development so delete in the comment window = 'ctrl'+'delete'...we know that sucks, but it works for the first release and will be first fix on the list.

**Future Features:**

- Comments box delete fix with inline comment tool-tip style additions.

- Full playback mode with a true time line.

- Audio playback and recording while coding tied to the time line bar.

- Better styling of the bar, and all package items.

- And much more!

- Issue a feature request or bug fix and we will do our best to get that resolved.
